# UnityRP-Report-System-ESX-
This Report system was previously coded by me (Keiron) for UnityRP. We currrently do no longer use this and have decided to branch out to a Custom Framework so I decided I would like to share this with everyone. 

# Credits
Credits goes to Keiron#1111 on Discord.

# Information
Please do not try and flag this off as your own. To use this it MUST be called 'unityrp_reportsystem', if not it may break the JS. People are welcome to create pull requests, maybe we can make this a big 'FiveM Project'?

# How do I use this?
If you have es_extended (also known as ESX 1.2) you can simply drag and drop this into your server. You MUST be set as a superadmin to view tickets, and of course make sure you change 'customNotification' to your notification system. I will offer support for this, but if I cannot help you or do not have time, I apologise. To open this menu, create a command e.g. /viewreports and make it trigger a client sided event called 'unityrp_reportsystem:openReports'; don't forget to do your isAdmin check!
